# Objective of this Project
For this project, the main objective was on learn how to copy the design of the portfolio from the project instructions on roadmap.sh. This was to learn CSS and how it interacts with HTML. Another object was to make the site responsive.

# Challenges
During this project, I had a hard time trying to style the content side by side. After doing some research, I was still confused with how to get the results I wanted. I used ChatGPT to help me with the CSS of the content. Before I implemented the code, I used W3Schools to double check the CSS.
